## Using RapidMiner GO with Tableau Products

This project aim to allow use of RapidMiner GO with Tableau products.

RapidMiner Go is a rapid visual prototyping and deployment tool for data scientists.You can build predictive models and use them to make predictions in the cloud.

Tableau can help anyone see and understand their data. Connect to almost any database, drag and drop to create visualizations, and share with a click.

With this integration we want to support use cases where a Tableau prep or Tableau dashboard user can easily upload data to RapidMiner Go to build predictive models and even deploy them automatically.

Such deployed models can then be used to score(predict) where the predictions are fed directly into the Tableau prep flows and into the dashboards.
